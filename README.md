## Stack shortcuts

Chrome extension to navigate stack overflow questions using the keyboard. Quite possibly duplicating existing functionality - created largely as a first play with chrome extensions, but also as a stub for more general ticket workflow utility.

Currently simply provides these shortcuts:

- `alt+shift+up` previous answer/post
- `alt+shift+down` next answer/post

The shortcut keys used should be configurable in chrome settings.
